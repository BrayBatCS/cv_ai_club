Emoji.py is the filter and images
Face_detection.py is the facial detection without filters or images
human_detection1.py is YoloV8 for object detection (humans, objects, dogs, etc.)

The other files are images used for overlaying things on the face.

Feel free to use the code and test it out for yourself!
